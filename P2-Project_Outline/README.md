## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    Coffee shops are places people can enjoy being together with family and friends, study, meet or do business. 
To make sure that everything goes well for the customers, coffee shop owners must make sure that they have enough
supply. In order to help them to keep track of their supplies, we decided to prepare an application. As small business 
owners, they will be able to see the available units, which products they should order, which products have expired, etc.  
*One of our group members works at a coffee shop but their inventory doesn't meet their needs so enhancing it was her 
idea.
